# Critical Review
<h1>The Spread of Obesity in a Large Social Network over 32 Years</h1>


 
<h2>Summary</h2>
 
<h3>Hypothesis:</h3>
In the United States, adults who are socially connected have a greater chance of becoming obese because they are being influenced by the appearance and behaviors around them.
 
<h3>Research Design:</h3>
In this study, associational research was used to compare relationships of clusters of people that extended to three degrees of separation.
 
<h3>Conditions and Variables:</h3>
They used the offspring cohort as the source of 5,124 subjects, or “egos.” The people who are linked to egos are called “alters.” In total, there were 12,067 living egos and alters who were connected at some point between 1971 to 2003. There were seven examinations in total that took place during 3-year periods. The examinations included measuring body mass index, calculating geographic distance between people, and assessing the relationship status that included spouses, siblings, friends, and neighbors. Also, smoking behavior of egos and alters was measured.
 
<h3>Findings:</h3>
At one degree of separation, the risk of obesity among alters who were connected to an obese ego was about 45% higher. At two degrees of separation, the risk of obesity was about 20% higher for alters’ alters. And at three degrees of separation, the risk was about 10% higher for alters’ alters’ alters. If the ego and alter had a mutual friendship, the ego’s risk of obesity increased 171% if the alter became obese. In same sex friendships if the alter became obese, the ego’s risk of becoming obese increased by 71 percent. If one sibling became obese, there was a 40% chance that the other sibling would become obese. An ego’s chance of becoming obese increased by 44% among brothers and 67% among sisters. When an alter became obese among married couples, the spouse was 37% more likely to become obese.

It was concluded that obesity appears to spread through certain social ties. Social distance appeared to be more important that geographic distance within the networks. If a neighbor gained weight, it did not affect the weight gain of the ego. There was more influence on weight gain if friends and siblings were of the same sex. Smoking behavior, whether an increase or decrease, was not a significant factor of obesity in this study.
 
 
 
 
 
<h2>Critical Thinking</h2>
 
<h4>Do you think this study is reproduce-able (like an exact recipe) or that the author left out too many details? What do you think needed more explanation?</h4>
 
I do not think this study is reproducible because there are too many factors that could influence the outcome differently. The study was not clear on how and where they recruited so many people. I think that upbringing, education, and demographic plays a huge part on people’s behavior and lifestyle. There needs to be more explanation of what factors influenced these people to become obese. The study kept referencing “social ties” among people who are connected and I think that is too broad. Also, the participants were only examined every 3 years. I think that in a 3-year time period, weight could fluctuate up and down, and this could alter the outcomes greatly.
 
<h4>Does this paper get its message across clearly? How or how not?</h4>
 
I think this paper gets its message across that obesity is increasing in the United States and that people need to become more aware of the health risks. The paper does a good job on educating the reader of how obesity can easily influence people in social settings over a long period of time. I think the paper could have better explained the different interventions for obese people, also to include lifestyle changes.
 
<h4>Does it change your thoughts or has it introduced new ideas to you? In what way?</h4>
 
This article has not changed my thoughts on obesity. I knew that obesity was on the rise in the United States due to busy daily schedules that lead people to convenient fast food restaurants. Also, there are many other factors that lead to obesity, not only in adults, but in children too. I did not know that social ties have a significant influence on whether or not someone’s chances of becoming obese increases. For example, it does make sense that one’s selection of food influences another, especially if they live together. I believe obesity is far more than just over-eating or lack of exercise, it first must be addressed psychologically and then interventions can be put in place for change.
 
<h4>Does this paper seem significant or not? Why or why not?</h4>
 
I believe this paper is significant because it is making people aware of a problem that is increasing quite rapidly. Many adults like to engage in all different kinds of social settings and this paper explains the chances of becoming obese among family members and friends in those settings. This paper hopefully makes people aware of their choices in those settings and how it could influence others. Ultimately people need to make better choices to reduce their risk of becoming obese.
 
 
 
<h4>Can you think of confounding variables that the author did not discuss?</h4>
 
There are a couple of confounding variables that the authors did not discuss in this paper. They did not account for age, education, and income level. With no or minimal activity level, as we age, our body mass index will increase. Our metabolism slows down, therefore increasing fat storage. Education plays an important factor of whether or not we become obese. People who are educated about nutrition and healthy life style choices are more likely to exercise and make better decisions. Along with education is income level. People who have more money, are likely to buy healthy and fresh foods as compared to boxed foods that are high in saturated fat.
